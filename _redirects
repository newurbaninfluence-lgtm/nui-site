# NUI Redirects — Specific routes FIRST, SPA fallback LAST
# Netlify processes _redirects top-to-bottom, first match wins

# Portal → dedicated app shell (admin/client/designer)
/portal    /app/index.html   200
/portal/*  /app/index.html   200
/app       /app/index.html   200

# SPA catch-all ONLY for unmatched routes (must be last)
# All other routes are handled by netlify.toml specific rules
